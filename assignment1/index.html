My moral compass was delivered to me in a convenient package, making decisions was simple. Don't know what to do? Well, just ask yourself, would Jesus do it? Not sure what he would do? Doesn't matter, what happens is all part of God's plan. Feeling guilty? Pray about it. I had a mental trash can to dump all my internal conflicts.<br><br>What's weird is that I spent a lot of time worrying about the path God wanted me to take. It's weird because I was a predeterminist, as were, and probably still are, a majority of devout Christians.
